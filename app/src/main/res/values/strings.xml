    <string name="about_message">Life Collage is the result of DevelopmentNow’s Velocity program. Velocity is a 5 week incubator for Junior Developers. \n\nIn this session of the Velocity program, Caleb Stevenson and Sheena Do decided to build Life Collage. Life Collage is a picture lifestyle app. It allows users to take pictures and add them to a collage. There are no tags, captions or comments, because we believe the pictures should speak for themselves. Users can also search for other users and view their collages. \n\nNow, we’ve all seen this type of app before. The thing that sets Life Collage apart is the ability to <i>pass</i> collages from one user to another. \n\nThis means if Kate passes her collage to Josh, she is entrusting its care to him. Josh now becomes the owner of that collage. Josh can add pictures to the collage until he decides to pass it off to Abby. And so on and so forth. The other interesting thing about passing is that because it uses Bluetooth, you actually have to be close enough to the other user in order to pass the collage. We think this creates an interesting tie to time and space that other sharing methods are missing. \n\n We hope you enjoy the app!\n\n- Sheena &amp; Caleb \n\nhttps://developmentnow.com \n\nIcon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com</string>
